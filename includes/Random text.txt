Hey I am the best
I know about organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, etc.
It is so so so irritating, despite having finished it all, I have to learn it all again.
Ugh, I hate chemistry! Especially organic chemistry!
Aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids....and the list goes on!


I simply just hate chemistry.
